        <h5>Eat more fruits and vegetables. </h5>   
        <p>Fruit and vegetables are good for our health, and most come with a low environmental impact. 
        There are exceptions, as some require a lot of resources to transport and keep fresh, so eating these less frequently can increase the sustainability of our diets. 
         Examples include:
        <ul>
            <li>fruits and vegetables that are fragile, or require refrigeration (salads and berries)</li>
            <li>vegetables that are grown in protected conditions (such as hot-house tomatoes or cucumbers)</li>
            <li>foods that use a lot of resources during transport (green beans, mange-touts, or berries imported from the southern hemisphere).</li>
        </ul></p><br><br>

        <h5>Avoid Eating more than needed.</h5>
        <p>Consuming only what we need reduces demands on our food supply by decreasing excess production. It also helps to keep us healthy and avoid excessive weight gain. 
            Limiting snacking on energy-dense low-nutrient foods and paying attention to portion sizes are all useful ways to avoid unnecessary overconsumption.
        </p><br><br>

        <h5>Swap Animals for plant based ones.</h5>
        <p>In general, more resources are needed to produce animal-based proteins (especially beef), compared to plant-based proteins (such as beans, pulses and some grains). Eating a more plant-based diet also brings health benefits: 
            plant-based food provides more fibre, and has a lower saturated fat content, both of which can contribute to a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.
        <ul>
            <li>For meat-eaters, limiting meat consumption to 1-2 times a week, having meat-free days and choosing more sustainable meats like chicken over beef can help us reduce our ecological footprint.</li>
            <li>For those choosing a vegan/vegetarian diet, combining different sources of plant-based protein will ensure our protein needs are met.</li>
        </ul></p><br><br>

        <h5>Choose Whole grains.</h5>
        <p>Non-refined cereals are generally less resource intensive to produce than refined ones as they require fewer processing steps. They are also good for health, reducing our risk of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and overweight.
            <ul>
                <li>Whole meal bread, whole grain pasta, unrefined barley, buckwheat and quinoa, are great choices.</li>
                <li>Brown rice is a good substitute for white rice, but it should be enjoyed in moderation, as a lot of water is used during its production.</li>
            </ul></p><br><br>

        <h5>Eat dairy products in moderation.</h5>
        <p>While milk and dairy production has an important environmental impact, dairy products are an important source of protein, calcium and essential amino acids, and have been linked to reduced risk of several chronic diseases, including metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure, stroke, bowel cancer and type 2 diabetes.
            <ul>
                <li>Enjoy low-fat unsweetened dairy products daily, but in moderation.</li>
                <li>Limit consumption of high-fat cheeses to occasional.</li>
            </ul></p>
